# Angular Transloco + Storybook integration

This is a sample project accompanying an [article](https://tsvetan.dev/blog/article/change-the-language-of-your-angular-components-in-storybook-using-transloco/) I've written about integrating Transloco and Storybook to change the language of Angular components inside Storybook's UI.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Storybook

You can launch Storybook by running `npm run storybook`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
